  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p>This document presents a visual representation of the motions put forth by different political
    parties in the Austrian parliament. We utilize WordStream to depict the topics that each party
    aimed to discuss over time.</p>

  <p>Our analysis encompasses 7 legislative periods spanning from 1996 to the present.
    The data is grouped by year, with the most significant terms displayed in a larger font size.
    The importance of a term is determined by its increased frequency compared to the previous year.
    This approach aims to highlight noteworthy shifts in party sentiment, rather than displaying
    commonly used terms associated with a particular party.
    Furthermore, the height of the plot reflects the total frequency of the words that each party put forth
    during a specific time.
    However, this is not directly equivalent to the total number of motions of each party.
  </p>

  <p>To enhance the visibility of topic changes, we represent multiple legislative periods
    within a single plot. The terms presented are derived either from the EuroVoc
    taxonomy, which classifies motions based on predefined categories, or from the
    full text of the motions themselves. EuroVoc, a multilingual thesaurus created and
    maintained by the Publications Office of the European Union, provides a
    standardized set of terms and concepts, ensuring efficient organization and retrieval
    of EU documents and resources across various languages.
    This classification system proves ideal for our purpose as it offers a clear categorization
    of motion topics. Conversely, utilizing the full text provides a more detailed understanding of
    motion content, albeit with the presence of specialized vocabulary and symbols not covered by
    common stop-word dictionaries.</p>

  <h2>Legislative Period XX-XXII</h2>

  <p>The Liberales Forum's participation in the parliament concluded with Legislative Period XX.
    In the subsequent periods, namely during the Schüssel I and II governments,
    the parliament consisted solely of the FPÖ, ÖVP, SPÖ, and Greens.
    Notably, when the SPÖ transitioned out of the government, their motion submissions increased significantly.</p>

    {{  plot_1[0] }}
    {{  plot_1[1] }}
  </div>

  <p>In addition to the EuroVoc-based topics, we also display the same periods using
    terms extracted from the full text of motions. To accomplish this, we parsed all
    the documents associated with the motion submissions, resulting in a comprehensive
    word list. However, it is important to note that this approach introduced numerous
    nonsensical words due to the presence of document designations and specialized vocabulary.
    Moreover, handling plural and singular forms of words posed additional challenges.

    {{  plot_2[1] }}

  <p>
    Despite these limitations, analyzing the full text provides more detailed insights
    into the content of the motions and the language used by the parties. We are certain that a higher quality of visualisations
    could be achieved by developing a more sophisticated preprocessing pipeline which uses corpus-specific stopwords,
    lemmatisations and named entity recognition. Nevertheless, due to the associated drawbacks of text documents, we
    made the decision to prioritize EuroVoc as the primary source for retrieving topics.
  </p>

  <h2>Legislative Period XXIII-XXV</h2>

  <p>During these periods, the parliamentary landscape witnessed the emergence of several new parties,
    including BZÖ, Team Stronach, and NEOS. Meanwhile, the SPÖ and ÖVP governments are
    reflected in the comparatively infrequent motion submissions of these parties.

  <h2>Legislative Period XXVI-XXVII</h2>

  <p>In the 26th legislative period, the green party ceased to be part of the parliament,
    making way for the newly formed Liste Pilz/JETZT. However, during their brief time in
    parliament, the new party did not present a substantial number of motions.
    In the subsequent 27th legislative period, the green party made a return to the parliament,
    even securing a position in the government. The number of motions from the FPÖ, which
    was now an opposition party once again, skyrocketed. </p>

  <h2>All Legislative Periods</h2>

  <p>By visualizing all legislative periods we get a more complete picture about how the discussions in parliament evolved.
  We can also see the surge in the number of motions around 2020 during the COVID19 pandamic. Due to the big difference
    in the number of motions, a lot of available screenspace in earlier legislative periods is not utilised. We see this
    as a limitation of the WordStream approach.

  <h2>Dataset</h2>

  <p>
  The dataset consist of motions submitted in the National Assembly of the
  <a href="https://www.parlament.gv.at/recherchieren/gegenstaende/index.html?FP_001NRBR=NR&FP_001GP_CODE=XXVII&FP_001VHG=ANTR">Austrian Parliament</a>.
    Included motions from the legislative periods XX to XXVII. Earlier motions do not provide EuroVoc keywords and documents are usually scanned.
  The data was obtained through the Open Data API by requesting the full list of motions per legislative period. Unfortunately
  this only provides some details for the motions. To get all data related to motions, like the documents or members of parliament who submitted them,
  each motion must be requested and parsed individually. The scripts we used to query and parse the data are also provided in the
  <a href="https://github.com/BernyWeiss/VIS2_WordStream/tree/main/wordstream/datapreparation">Github Repository</a>. For the WordStream visualisation
    on the fulltext corpus of motions a simple preprocessing pipline was developed. It consists of tokenization, casefolding and stopwords removal.
    For stopword removal we used a standard german stopword list an added terms which appeared very frequently but didn't provide any semantic meaning.
